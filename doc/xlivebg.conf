# example xlivebg configuration file
# copy to one of the following locations, and customize:
#
#   ~/.xlivebg/config
#   ~/.config/xlivebg.conf  (preferred user configuration file)
#   /etc/xlivebg.conf       (system-wide configuration)
#
# The config paths are searched in the order listed, and the first one found
# will be used; the rest, if they exist, are ignored. So if you have a
# system-wide config in /etc and you wish to override one option for a specific
# user, copy the whole file over, and modify it.

	# black areas inhibit motion. Same file formats are accepted as for the
	# image option above, but will be converted to greyscale before use.

	#       bars if necessary.
	#     - "crop": zoom all the way in and crop the image. the "crop_dir"
	#       option can be used to adjust which areas will be cropped.
	#     - "stretch": stretch the image to fill the screen, distorting the
	#       aspect ratio if necessary.

	# part of the image will be visible after cropping (if cropping is
	# necessary).
